# Bingo-Roller
A cool Bingo Roller made in C#

# Running the Bingo Roller
You can run the project by using the executable in /bin/Debug/

## How to use
There are two ways to use this Bingo Roller
  - Manually Rolling using the 'roll me' button
  - Using the auto-roll feature
Both ways are viable although obviously one makes more sense than the other to use. When resetting the board simply click the 'Got Bingo' button
